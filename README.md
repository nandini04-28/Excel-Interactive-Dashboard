# Excel-Interactive-Dashboard
📊 Excel Interactive Dashboard

An interactive dashboard built in Microsoft Excel to visualize and explore data effectively.
This project demonstrates how to create a dynamic and user-friendly dashboard in Excel — including interactive charts, slicers, and data filtering — based on step-by-step guidance from the video tutorial like this one: How to Build Excel Interactive Dashboards 
YouTube

🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains an Excel workbook (.xlsx) with an interactive dashboard that visualizes sample data with at least three different visualizations (e.g., income vs expenses, calories consumed vs burned, etc.) and provides interactive filtering controls.
The project shows how Excel can be used for data analysis, visualization, and interactive reporting — turning raw data into meaningful insights without advanced tools like Power BI.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

✔ Microsoft Excel
The main tool used for data visualization and dashboard creation, including:
PivotTables — for summarizing structured data
PivotCharts — for creating dynamic charts that update automatically
Slicers & Timelines — for interactive filtering and drill-downs
Tables & Named Ranges — for organized, structured data
Basic Excel functions — to support calculations and dynamic updates 

📑 Features

🎯 Interactive Filters
Use slicers and timelines to filter charts in real time by category or date.
📈 Dynamic Charts
Visualizations update automatically as filters change.
📊 Multiple Visual Views
Displays at least 3 chart types (bar, line, pie, etc.) to convey different aspects of the dataset.

🧩 User-Friendly Layout
Dashboard is structured for clarity — all charts and controls on a dedicated “Dashboard” tab.

📌 How It Works

Load Data
Import or enter your dataset into Excel in a structured table format.

Build PivotTables
Summarize key data points (like totals or averages) used for charts.

Add PivotCharts
Create charts tied to the PivotTables for visualization.

Insert Slicers
Add slicers/timelines to allow users to interact with and filter data.

Design Dashboard
Arrange charts and slicers into a clean dashboard layout for easy viewing.
